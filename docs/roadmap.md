## Planned

Below are listed the planned features:

* Middleware should be fixed to have proper access to locations, res (modify
  component), and next.
* add plugin system for browser/react and extend to include Vue.js, Svelte, etc
* add plugin system for middleware (auth?)

## Suggestions

Below are listed the suggested features that may likely be implemented:

* component should be able to be overridden so that we can specify a component,
  page, or other type

* We like MVC, lets add models and controllers? (Try to not make it a mess like
  Angular)

* Server-side rendering

* Dynamic loading of pages (code splitting)
